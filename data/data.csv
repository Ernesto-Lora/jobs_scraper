154,TEFL-PP Course,"Each summer, EDUCO organises hundreds of ESL summer camps for Italian children (ages 6 - 18) across the country. Each camp is overseen by an Italian camp director and camp activities are facilitated by a group of mother tongue English speaking tutors. Camps last either one or two weeks and take place throughout the whole summer from June - September in locations all across Italy, including Sicily and Sardinia.-
-
Our camps offer a unique experience for Italian children as they do not adhere to traditional teaching methods, and instead use theatre and ‘play’ to inspire a joy for second language learning. Our expansive ESL repertoire draws on drama techniques, songs and games, immersing Italian children in an engaging and interactive setting throughout the camp week.-
-
Our tutors are recruited from all across the world to participate in our -. They attend a mandatory orientation prior to being sent out to our camps.-
-
EDUCO’S TEFL-PP course is made up of three components:-
-
-All tutors must attend our orientation training in Italy, prior to being sent out to EDUCO camps. The orientation takes place in Sanremo (Liguria) and lasts five days, for a total of 40 hours of training. Tutors are trained by EDUCO’s didactic team, all of whom have years of experience as international educators and teacher trainers, in addition to hundreds of hours of work experience in our camps.-
-
While at orientation, tutors will immerse themselves in EDUCO’s extensive TEFL repertoire, with a strong focus on language acquisition through the use of drama techniques, songs and games. Training will cover everything from lesson planning techniques and how to pre-teach for second language learners, to classroom management and cultural norms within Italy. The daily schedule at orientation is modelled off of the EDUCO camp weekly schedule, and activities are carried out as they would be during regular camp hours.-
-
-
-
All tutors who participate on our course are required to complete a minimum of two weeks in EDUCO camps following their orientation. While at camp, tutors are supervised by their camp directors (who are almost always Italian ESL teachers working in the public education system). Each director is responsible for providing feedback on their tutors, both during the camp week and following the completion of the camp.-
-
-
-
All tutors who participate on our course receive a study grant for their time in camp. Depending on the number of camps completed, tutors move up in the study grant/course levels. We expect certain teaching and cultural objectives to have been met upon the completion of each level.-
-
Our final summer 2024 orientation will take place from:-
-
August 18th to 23rd-

***The normal 200 euro fee for didactic material and accommodation at orientation is waived. All didactic material and room and board will be FREE of charge for our final orientation.****-

We collaborate with orphanages and charity programs around the country and donate to the Borneo Nature Foundation. We all feel it’s important to protect the amazing environment of this country.-

-
We work with schools all around the country, so if you have a preference for where you want to be placed, we can try to facilitate this. However popular placements like Bali or Lombok we will give preference to the candidates with better qualifications or experience.

We are happy to say we offer more than what other language providers will give, especially for teachers who are new to the industry. This will immediately place you in the top percentage of earners in the country and is enough for a very comfortable living.

If your feedback is good from the school you are placed at (you teach well, are well dressed, consistently on time) we will increase your salary significantly.-
-
All newcomers will also receive a welcome package to help them settle in.-
-
-
-
You will be teaching classes of 10-30 students. The culture here respects teachers greatly, so students are very well-behaved - especially so as they are thrilled to learn with a foreigner (there are not many foreigners here, so expect to be treated as a minor celebrity).-
-
Usually, classes range from 30 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes per session. You will be teaching classes that focus on conversation and listening ability.-
-
The age of students ranges from 3 years old to 18 years old. If you’re looking to teach adults exclusively, we will have programs for that in the coming months.-

Full-time positions are around 24 class periods per week, with the remaining time for planning, grading, and supervisory duties (morning, afternoon, or break). Positions are classified according to school.-
Elementary School (Grades 1-5)-
Middle School (Grades 6-8)-
High School (Grades 9-12)-
-
All English classes are full English immersion. Early elementary classes introduce students to English letters, sounds, and written forms, and focus on steadily increasing students' reading, writing, listening, speaking, and grammar capabilities in English as well as instilling positive classroom behavior and a joy of learning. In later elementary and middle school classes, students read both fictional and informational books, novels, or other texts and develop their reading, writing, and grammar skills.-
-
Teachers are responsible for using and following the curriculum and curriculum map provided by the school. Teachers are also responsible for developing their own supporting materials and weekly lesson plans. Teachers should feel comfortable working independently and be ready to dedicate time to planning thoughtful and rigorous lessons, which help students learn how to think critically and guide them to consider multiple ways and methods of solving problems, through which they apply what they have learned to solve problems they face in their own lives. Games, activities, and projects that engage students and support learning are highly encouraged at all grade levels.-

-
With around 300,000 people, Nablus is one of the largest cities on the West Bank. Teachers are able to form lasting relationships with colleagues and friends, take advantage of opportunities to learn or practice Arabic, and travel on holidays, weekends, and breaks to explore all the West Bank has to offer. Nablus is still a conservative city with respect to the West Bank as a whole, and in order to maintain the school's good reputation and standing in the community, foreign teachers are expected to uphold certain standards of behaviour and dress during their tenure with the school.-

Our aim is for our students to go out in the world and use their English in social and professional interactions as well as gain their qualifications in English.  We limit our class sizes to a maximum of 4 students; this provides an ideal learning and teaching environment for our students but it also provides us with the opportunity to work on developing our students’ self-confidence as well as their English.  Due to the small class sizes, we can place our students according to their level of English rather than their age.  We are also a registered Trinity College London Examination Centre.-

Our students enroll with us for a variety of reasons, here are some of the most common:-
-
Practice English-
Improve confidence in speaking English-
Prepare for primary and secondary school interviews – often there’s a part of the interview requiring children to speak in English.-
Learn phonics-
Improve reading, writing and grammar-

Greetings!-

We have been placing teachers in Korea since 2005 with zero complaints, and this is because we at TEIK (www.teachenglishinkorea.org) are a husband-and-wife team (Brad and Yumi) who have both taught, lived, and worked in Korea for TEIK since 2005. We pride ourselves on being a boutique recruitment agency that always focuses on our teachers getting the best job opportunity that fits the teacher's qualifications, experience, and preferences. We are a very laid-back, low-pressure ex-pat owned and run agency.-
-
TEIK is the best run recruitment agency placing high-quality teachers at high-quality schools. We only work with schools with an excellent track record for paying their teachers on time, drama-free, and honoring teachers' contracts. We are a boutique recruitment agency owned and run by ex-pats. Based in Incheon, Korea, we focus on the 'QUALITY' of teachers rather than the placement 'QUANTITY' of teachers. So, if you are a diligent college graduate who loves children, is seeking an adventure abroad, wants to save a lot of money, and is flexible, then be sure to contact us. Please email us your resume, current smiling passport-style photo, and fill out the 2-minute job application on our website below.-
-
Our goal is to send quality teachers to quality schools, period. If you want to work with an American-owned and run recruitment agency that has lived, taught, and placed teachers in Korea since 2005, we would love the opportunity to work with you. Unlike other recruiters, we at TEIK pride ourselves on helping build our teacher's social network by introducing new teachers to our current teachers living in Korea to help develop a sense of community and help our teachers smoothly transition into a new country's culture and adventure. Most recruiters are Korean, Korean schools, or Korean-owned agencies, and they care most about the school and less about you. TEIK, on the other hand, is teacher-centric, where your needs come first. Other recruitment agencies believe that their job finishes when you arrive in Korea, but we at TEIK believe that our job is only half-finished after you come. We keep in contact with you throughout your entire placement, and we are here to give you advice and support when you need it. Check out our testimonials page and feel confident that you will be working with a company that you can understand and, more importantly, who can understand you. Please email us your resume and current photo, and fill out the 1-minute online job application on the link below.-
-
If you are not 100% certain that you feel that you would be a great candidate to teach English in Korea, then don't waste both of our time because I only want to work with caring and honest individuals who have an adventurous spirit, love to travel, meet new people and who love teaching children. I hope you choose to go to Korea through us and have a fantastic experience like I did; you won't regret it if you decide to go. I paid off $25,000 in student loans in my first 15 months in Korea, and the average teacher saves $10,000-$15,000 per year. In addition, most teachers can comfortably live in Korea on less than $1,000 per month, so you should save more than 50% of your monthly salary. During my time in Korea, I was also able to meet new lifelong Korean and international friends, learn about a fantastic culture, travel to several exotic neighboring countries, try excellent food, and have fun doing it!-

Shanghai is the definition of a megacity, and home to one of the country’s most international communities. As a commercial and cultural center, it rivals the likes of Paris and New York.-

The district of Qingpu, where the school is located, allows for a superb quality of life with a slower pace and a more Chinese ‘feel’. Living downtown can often feel like you are in just another western city, but Qingpu never lets you forget you are living in China.-

The cost of living in either suburban town is 30-40 percent cheaper than it is living downtown. While you teach English in China you’ll have more money left to travel around the country and nearby countries, pay off student loans, or start a nest egg.","Up to 20,000 RMB","","",China > Shanghai,Saxoncourt

Why Teachers Love Chengdu-
-
The Chinese describe Chengdu as the city people never want to leave, or “The land of milk and honey” due to its agricultural value. The city is globally renowned for its spicy cuisine and tea culture.-
-
Chengdu is locally known for its relaxed and laid back lifestyle, and it has the perfect blend of adventure and comfort.

In the city however, you can wander around the old-quarters, grab some spicy hotpot with friends or relax at one of the city’s many temples.-
-
Chengdu is famous for giant pandas, and mahjong is very popular there.-
-
When you teach English in Chengdu, you’ll notice the city doesn’t have much western influence like Shanghai or Beijing. This also means that not as many people speak English, so living here can be a bit more challenging, and more authentic.",10000-12000 RMB,"","",China > Chengdu,Saxoncourt

The district of Qingpu-
-
The district of Qingpu, where the school is located, allows for a superb quality of life. Qingpu has most of the amenities of downtown Shanghai but has a slower pace and a more Chinese ‘feel’. Living downtown can often feel like you are in just another western city, but Qingpu never lets you forget you are living in China.-
Foreign staff may choose to live in Qingpu town, or 12 kilometers to the west in a small developing 500-year-old water town called Zhujiajiao (pronounced jew-jaw-j-oww). With its small ancient canal town and rural population, many foreign staff members have chosen to make this their home.-
The cost of living in both suburban towns is 30-40 percent cheaper than it is living downtown. While you teach English in China you’ll have more money left to travel around the country and nearby countries, pay off student loans, or start a nest egg.",20000 RMB,"","",China > Shanghai,Saxoncourt

-
Also please note that all vacations and holidays are paid (summer holiday – Christmas – spring break and winter break)-
-
International schools :-
With such a large expatriate population, Kuwait has a considerable number of international schools. In the state you’ll find the British, American and International Baccalaureate curriculum on offer, as well as numerous Indian and Pakistani private schools, and bilingual English and Arabic schools.-
-
Salaries and packages vary from school to school, but as an English-speaking teacher you’ll be able to find some very competitive offers.-
-
According to Marchant, the salaries at the top schools will match those anywhere in the world, and the capacity to save “is massive”.-
-
“People do save a lot of money. All the schools give you state medical insurance, so you’re covered in Kuwait, but there’s not the private healthcare you’d get in Dubai or China.-
-
“There’s one return flight home per year per person and you’ll get a two-bedroom apartment. Salary-wise, we’re competitive, but we’re not offering villas, multiple flights and all those things.”-
-
Culture and society :-
Kuwait is a dry state, so the boozy brunches that are a mainstay of expat culture in more westernised Gulf states don’t exist, but eating out is still a popular way to socialise.-
-
Most Western restaurant chains and shops can be found and there are numerous societies and sports clubs. Many of the hotels have beach clubs offering memberships, which offer a good place to relax when temperatures rise over summer.-
-
Weather:-
Between the end of October and mid-April, the temperatures in Kuwait are usually somewhere in the twenties (degrees C). From May to September, however, it’s not uncommon to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius.-
-
Travel opportunities:-
Owing to the intense summer heat, the international school term finishes in mid June, giving teachers approximately 10 weeks’ holiday over the summer. Numerous airlines fly from Kuwait, to Delhi in four hours, Sri Lanka in five, London in six and Bangkok in seven.-
-
To drive in Kuwait, you will need a Kuwaiti driving licence. To obtain this you’ll need to meet the eligibility requirements, which include your residency category and salary. You may be able to transfer your UK licence, but this will require you to get your UK licence attested by the UK Foreign Office.-
-
Life in Kuwait :-
Having been teaching in Kuwait for 18 years, Marchant has experienced at first hand what living and working in the country entails:-
-
I moved to Kuwait in September 2001 to take up the post of chemistry teacher at the New English School (NES) and have been here ever since. I was made head of year in 2003 and deputy headteacher in 2004. After a sideways move to a post for assessment, development and learning in 2010, I was made secondary headteacher in 2017 and principal in 2018.-
-
I began teaching science full time in 1996 in Cambridgeshire and moved to Essex to take up the post of head of year 10 in 1999. Then a friend of a friend who worked at NES suggested that I should consider applying here. I have always loved travel and had thought about the opportunity to work in an international school. Money was very tight working in the UK so I put in an application and was successful.-
-
Requirments :-
- candidates have to have a degree in related teaching subjects. For example, Math Teacher has to have a Bachelor degree in Math. Homeroom Teacher, has to have a degree in Education etc.-

Poland is one of the world’s fastest growing TEFL destinations due to its charming culture, beautiful medieval cities, cheap cost of living, and the widespread availability of jobs for native English speakers.

-
Poland’s major cities, including Warsaw, Krakow, Gdansk, and Wroclaw, have an abundance of teaching jobs available and don’t suffer from oversaturation of English teachers like some European cities such as Barcelona, Prague, and Florence do. At least not yet!-
-
English teachers will find a wide variety of jobs available in Poland. In the private sector, there are opportunities to teach at private language schools which cater to both adults and children, as well as preschools. Business English is also growing rapidly, and many teachers will sign contracts directly with a company to teach their employees. Jobs in primary and secondary schools exist as well, mostly in the form of teaching assistantships. Private tutoring is also very popular.-
-
Schools hire teachers year-round to fill the constant demand, with peak hiring season being at the start of the academic year in September. Although summer camps are not as widespread as they are in other European countries, teachers who choose to stick around over the summer usually have no problem keeping their schedule full until the fall.-
-
Salaries for native teachers range between €8 and €16 per hour, depending on your experience and qualifications. With a typical teaching workload of 25 hours per week, a teacher should expect to earn something in the range of €750 to €1500 per month.

REASONS TO TEACH IN JAPAN-
• Time to explore. Teaching in Japan gives you loads of time off to explore the country. You’ll get plenty of days off and even entire weeks off during the year. So get out and find something new!-
• Sushi, sake, ramen, manga, anime and Japanese punk. Alright, that was 6 things for the price of one, but we can’t get too crazy with this list.-
• The subcultures of Tokyo. If you’re not sure what Rockabilly, Dekora, Fairy Kai, or Gyaru are all about, there’s only one way to truly find out.-
• It’s unbelievably refreshing how polite the Japanese are.-
• Japan has an abundance of natural wonders. Every bit of modern tech that can be found in Tokyo city is equaled by a piece of Japanese wilderness that can only be truly appreciated by being there in person. Ancient temples in misty mountains. Roaring waterfalls into crystal blue rivers. Turquoise blue oceans and white sand beaches. There is no shortage of fresh air to be found.-
• You can hit the slopes, too. Grab your skis and head to the Japanese Alps. After a year of teaching, you might have a new favorite sport.-
• The money is good. There is a big market for learning English in Japan, and schools are willing to pay teachers very well. For all there is to experience in a year of teaching in Japan, it’s crazy to think that you can still come back with way more money than you left with.-
